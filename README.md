# TDAC

This repository contains:

1) The source code of a solver implementation, written in Matlab, of the analytical model presented in the article. The script TDAC_scenario_1_public.m is suitable for cases with a single data set, and it allows to reproduce the results in the article for Scenario 1. The script TDAC_scenario_2_public.m is suitable for cases with multiple data sets, and it allows to reproduce the results in the article for Scenario 2

2) The source code of the simulator, written in C, which has been used in the article for evaluating the model accuracy. It is suitable for simulating cases with both single data set and mutiple data sets. It allows to reproduce the results in the article for both Scenario 1 and Scenario 2

The source code of the solver implementation has been succesfully compiled with with Matlab R2021a. 
The source code of the simulator has been succesfully compiled with gcc version 9.3.0
